## An rmarkdown template for stats homework

Additional recommendations:
  - Create an RStudio project for the class
  - Keep each assignment in a separate folder
  - Have a separate folder for:
    - `data`
    - `figures`

I tend to keep the LaTeX macro file at the top level so I only have a single copy.
